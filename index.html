        My hobby is reading interseting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school, I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 11 years old and read in class 6th standard. Now I know that reading is a very good habit which can make me a complete scientist. This hobby can be developed by anybody however I got it naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual, and most importantly a successful person in the life.</section>
